This application works as a E-commerce website with ability to register, login, place order and receiving notification (as email).  
This web application is designed using a microservices architecture, enabling modular development and deployment. Each microservice handles a specific business function including customer, notification, order, product, payment mangement. The application uses RESTful APIs for communication between services (using OpenFeign and RestTemplate).

Kafka is also be used as the real-time message query, ensuring the functionality of notification (as email). API Gateway works as a Load Balancer to balancing the loads of request inside an Eureka server, where all the services being held and run.
